		<p> Hello, and welcome to my very first website! My name is Diana Justus.  A little bit about me, I am originally from Peru.
		I have been living in Michigan for over 13 years now. I was 18 years old when I first came to the United States with basic English,
        alone, but full of dreams. Getting used to a new country, a different language, climate, food, and culture was a big challenge, but
        I was determined to overcome every single challenge that came my way.  		
		I'm a proud mother of two beautiful and super smart kids, and a wife to a wonderful husband.  Now that our kids are full time
		students, I have decided to go back to college and pursuit my associate's degree in CIS. Technology has always been a path that
		I was interested in.  Back in my country I was studying Software Engineering but the opportunity to come to the United States presented
		itself and I took a leap of faith, and here I am, trying to make the best of what this life has to offer everyday. This is my first attempt to 
		create a website. I hope you enjoy my very simple yet very well loved website.</p>
