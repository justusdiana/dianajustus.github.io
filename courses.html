	<h1>CIS 1300 - Networking Concepts</h1>
	<p>This course is about how to install, configure and troubleshoot a computer network. It introduces the fundamental building
	    blocks that form a modern network, such as hardware, topologies, and protocols, along with the introduction to the OSI Model.
		One of the projects I had to do was about giving a recommendation for a network solution for a small company,
		involving the network topology, and network models.
